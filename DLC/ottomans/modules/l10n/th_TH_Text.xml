Paranoia about future independence movements among the empire’s diverse population led to the perpetration of several genocides, including that of Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks, and Kurds. The Ottomans allied with Germany during WWI and saw initial success until the Arab Revolt; after the war, Ottoman territory was heavily partitioned by the Allies.

Still active nearly 350 years after its creation, it was instrumental in defending Constantinople from the British during the Dardanelles operation of 1807. Its giant cannonballs were fired on the British ships, causing immense damage and quickly putting an end to their mission.

With their aid, Hayreddin cast the Spanish out of Algiers and turned its harbor into the corsairs' base. From there, Barbary corsairs, now holding the status of "beylerbey" (prince) from the Ottomans, plundered the seas, enriching Algiers, and through it the Empire, until the mid-19th century.</Text>		<!-- The most well-known of the Barbary corsairs were the Barbarossa brothers, the surname meaning “redbeard” in Italian. Known as Oruç Reis to the Turks, Aruj Barbarossa was a fearsome pirate, capturing hundreds of ships across the Mediterranean but especially from Spain. He and his brothers liberated Algiers from the Spaniards, rescued Muslims from the Spanish mainland, and pillaged the Spanish coast. In 1519, after the Spanish finally succeeded in killing Aruj in a battle in North Africa, his brother, Hayreddin Barbarossa, traded Algiers' independence to the Ottomans for assistance against the Spaniards. With their aid, Hayreddin cast the Spanish out of Algiers and turned its harbor into the corsairs' base. From there, Barbary corsairs, now holding the status of "beylerbey" (prince) from the Ottomans, plundered the seas, enriching Algiers, and through it the Empire, until the mid-19th century. -->
