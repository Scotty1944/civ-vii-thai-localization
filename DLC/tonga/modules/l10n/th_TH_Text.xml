Vaikaukau, conical manmade wells, were constructed nearby as sacred bathing spaces reserved for the king.

He climbed a giant tree up to the sky realm of the gods where he met his father and a host of older brothers. They played and competed in a variety of sports, and quickly 'Aho'eitu proved to be the favorite. Jealous, his brothers murdered him, throwing his head into the bushes, and cooking his body to eat. When their father asked after 'Aho'eitu, he realized what the brothers had done. Calling for a great kava bowl, he forced the brothers to vomit up 'Aho'eitu into the bowl and to place his head in as well.
