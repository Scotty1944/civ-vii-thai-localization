Unlike the more war-inclined French, the British used a variety of means of domination. For instance, debt became a key tool; preying on rulers’ desire for finished goods, British merchants urged them to accrue immense debts and then those debts could be “paid” by allowing the British to “manage” the finances. This is how Malaya and Egypt fell to the British. Meanwhile, Central Asia was the site of the “Great Game,” a strategic rivalry against Russia for mastery of the region.</Text>		<!-- In short, the British created a worldwide system – for the benefit of London.

			<Text>The utter transformation of English society in the 19th century as a result of the Industrial Revolution cannot be overstated. Whereas an activity such as weaving had in previous centuries been done in the countryside in large family homesteads, now, if a wealthy investor bought spinning and twisting machinery, he could rapidly outproduce any home industry. These machines needed steel and coal, and so these industries too began to rise. The operation of machines also required a workforce, preferably low-wage and unskilled, inducing people to move en masse from the countryside to the city. As these workers were paid wages and had no land to work, they needed more commodities, produced by the factories in which they worked. And as these machines needed more and more raw materials, largely from Britain’s colonies, colonial control grew tighter and tighter. It was a system that squeezed what it could from workers, colonial subjects, and the land itself, and yielded massive quantities of product and profit. </Text>		<!-- The utter transformation of English society in the 19th century as a result of the Industrial Revolution cannot be overstated.
