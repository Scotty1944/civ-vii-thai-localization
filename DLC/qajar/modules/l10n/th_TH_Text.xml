Constructed in Isfahan and bedecked with gold and gemstones, it is named for the sun disk atop its back, which rotated through a clockwork mechanism. When it was repaired during the reign of Naser al-Din Shah, he had poetic verses added to the throne on the topic of its restoration. The throne is sometimes called the Peacock Throne, though not after the Mughal throne of the same name, which also resided in Iran after its seizure by Nader Shah in the 18th century. Rather, Fath Ali Shah is said to have renamed the Sun Throne in honor of his favorite wife. Today, it is on display in the Central Bank of Iran. -->
