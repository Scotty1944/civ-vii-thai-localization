Unlike other Phoenician city-states, which consolidated their power within their own walls, the Carthaginians pursued an agenda of territorial conquest to expand their borders.

			<Text>Although the full nature of Carthaginian religion, its gods and practices, lies concealed behind missing and untrustworthy sources, the goddess Tanit has survived through her pervasive presence in the city and its colonies. A goddess of wisdom, fertility, and motherhood, she was one of Carthage’s chief deities, together with her consort, Baal Hammon. Tanit was a late addition to the Punic pantheon – while Baal Hammon has roots in Phoenicia and beyond, Tanit emerged around the fifth century BCE, possibly via local Berber beliefs, and soon outstripped her consort in Carthage in importance and reverence. Worship of Tanit seems to have included human sacrifice in the tophet, a sacred sanctuary, though the degree to which such rituals were practiced by the Carthaginians is under debate. Her symbol, the same used in this game to represent Carthage, is commonly found in stone carvings and mosaics; later depictions show her with wings and the head of a lion.</Text>		<!-- Although the full nature of Carthaginian religion, its gods and practices, lies concealed behind missing and untrustworthy sources, the goddess Tanit has survived through her pervasive presence in the city and its colonies.

			<Text>Carthage began as a Phoenician colony, a small coastal outpost founded to facilitate and control trade across the Mediterranean.
