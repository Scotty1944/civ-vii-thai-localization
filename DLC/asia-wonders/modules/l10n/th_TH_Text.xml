			<Text>One of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a tomb built c. 353-351 BCE for Mausolus, ruler of Caria in western Anatolia. It was a magnificent structure designed and decorated by the most talented Greek architects and sculptors of the day, boasting elaborate reliefs, hundreds of sculptures, and a four-horse chariot at its peak, in which stood statues of Mausolus and his wife (and sister) Artemisia. It is from Mausolus and his tomb that the word “mausoleum” originates. The structure survived well into the Middle Ages, but was destroyed, likely by an earthquake, between the 11th and 15th centuries CE, though fragments remain.</Text>		<!-- One of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a tomb built c. 353-351 BCE for Mausolus, ruler of Caria in western Anatolia.

			<Text>While some Theravada Buddhist temples in Southeast Asia served as community schools and gathering places, others were there to highlight the majesty of a royal reign. Located in Luang Phrabang, the old capital of the Laotian kingdom of Lan Xang (“one million elephants”), Wat Xieng Thong is one of these latter. It was built around 1560 by the Lao king Setthathirath at the height of Lan Xang’s power, in the wake of its defense against invading Burmese armies and before yet another victory over the armies of Ayutthaya (Siam). Its sweeping, telescopic roof gives it its sense of grace and elegance, and its perspective over the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers situate it in place – and, according to legend, are home to the naga spirits that bless the place.</Text>		<!-- While some Theravada Buddhist temples in Southeast Asia served as community schools and gathering places, others were there to highlight the majesty of a royal reign.
