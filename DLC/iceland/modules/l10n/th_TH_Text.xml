			<Text>Today, medieval Iceland’s claim to fame is of course the Vikings. We will talk about them shortly, but Iceland was much more than a society of raiders.

Their houses were built of turf and stone, and they relied on alliances to survive the harsh environment.

They developed a law system and unique proto-parliament to solve social issues as a community; they produced some of the North’s greatest warriors and explorers; they composed some of the finest medieval poems and sagas; and they preserved and iterated on traditional Norse society even as the continental kingdoms transformed into more European-style powers.</Text>		<!-- Today, medieval Iceland’s claim to fame is of course the Vikings.

			<Text>Iceland’s system of government is key to understanding how the island operated from its settlement. Eschewing a centralized government, the Icelanders allocated power to 39 goðar (sing. goði), chieftains who served as secular and religious leaders in their area. The goðar had many duties: they were arbiters of justice, resolving lawsuits or representing their followers in court; they led local religious ceremonies and maintained temples and later churches; they organized and presided over their local assemblies; and they provided for constituents in need, such as sustaining farmers if a harvest failed. In return for his services, the goði’s followers supported him at the assemblies, lending him legal power. Notably, Icelanders were not locked into their local goði – if they didn’t like the goði in their area, they could choose to swear themselves to another one, or none at all. In this way, the goði’s power was determined not by land, but by population, and the Icelanders were free to follow (or not follow) any leader they chose.</Text>		<!-- Iceland’s system of government is key to understanding how the island operated from its settlement.

			<Text>By the time of Iceland’s settlement, the Viking Age was in full swing, and many men spent their formative years as raiders. In Iceland’s first decades, independent raids were launched from the island, but they were difficult to finance. All raiding parties needed a ship, but because Iceland was (and still is) sparse on trees, obtaining a vessel required importing timber from Norway or purchasing a ship second-hand. Prospective Vikings would band together to buy a ship, each purchasing a share until they communally owned the whole vessel. Later on, as the kingdom of Norway developed into a powerhouse, it became more lucrative for Icelanders to sail to Norway and join the king’s retinue for several years, where they would raid as part of the royal fleet (or wage war on Denmark). For these raids, they did not keep what they personally seized, but they were still paid handsomely by the king. Per the sagas, Icelanders were considered excellent Vikings and were highly valued by the Norwegian kings; but they could also be difficult to manage, because they were unapologetically independent and had little regard for royal trappings.</Text>		<!-- By the time of Iceland’s settlement, the Viking Age was in full swing, and many men spent their formative years as raiders.

			<Text>Despite the geographical isolation of their island, Icelanders traveled widely through the known world and beyond, as raiders, mercenaries, merchants, and explorers.

			<Text>At home, Iceland was always a learned society. In addition to the law code that was orally transmitted and recited at the Althing, the island was famous for producing some of the greatest skalds (poets). Old Norse poetry is highly complex, with strict metrical requirements, its own poetic language, and deep references to mythology and legend. The Icelandic skalds were so skilled that they were frequently hired by continental kings as court poets. The Icelanders were also famed composers of sagas. These works were initially passed down orally, but after Iceland converted to Christianity in the year 1000, literacy spread rapidly, and by the end of the 12th century, the period of saga writing was in full swing.

			<Text>The family sagas are tales of feuds between major families in Viking Age Iceland, relating events that were passed down orally for two to three centuries before their preservation in the manuscripts. They explore the boundaries of order and violence in Iceland, and often follow a common narrative – an inciting incident sparks conflict that pings back and forth between two factions until it can no longer be contained by the law and explodes in a bloody climax; surviving characters then work to reign in the hostilities, and the saga ends when equilibrium and peace are reached once more. Rich in violence, adventure, romance, and the supernatural, each saga is distinct in its characters, themes, and actions, spotlighting the notable men and women of the Viking Age. The crown jewel of the family sagas is the immense Njáls saga; other major works include Egils saga, Laxdæla saga, Gísla saga, and the Vinland sagas, which relate the Norse voyages to North America. </Text>		<!-- The family sagas are tales of feuds between major families in Viking Age Iceland, relating events that were passed down orally for two to three centuries before their preservation in the manuscripts.
